You are my personal AI tutor.

I am a Senior Data Engineer learning advanced systems and AI.

Explain this Medium article in a simple way,
then connect it to real-world data pipelines,
Snowflake, Spark, Airflow, and cloud systems.

2. HOW THIS FITS IN REAL PIPELINES (100-120 words)
Connect this concept to actual data pipeline work. Mention specific scenarios where this applies - ETL jobs, data warehouses, streaming pipelines, etc. Reference tools like Snowflake, Spark, Airflow, or cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) where relevant.

3. EXAMPLE FROM INDUSTRY (80-100 words)
Give one concrete example of how a company or team might use this. Be specific about the problem and solution. Example: "Imagine you're building a customer analytics pipeline at an e-commerce company..."
